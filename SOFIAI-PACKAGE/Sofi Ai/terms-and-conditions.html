            <h2>SEVERABILITY</h2>
            <p>
              In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is
              determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision
              shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted
              by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed
              to be severed from these Terms of Service, such determination
              shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other
              remaining provisions.
            </p>

            <h2>TERMINATION</h2>
            <p>
              The obligations and liabilities of the parties incurred prior to
              the termination date shall survive the termination of this
              agreement for all purposes. These Terms of Service are effective
              unless and until terminated by either you or us. You may terminate
              these Terms of Service at any time by notifying us that you no
              longer wish to use our Services, or when you cease using our site.
              If in our sole judgment you fail, or we suspect that you have
              failed, to comply with any term or provision of these Terms of
              Service, we also may terminate this agreement at any time without
              notice and you will remain liable for all amounts due up to and
              including the date of termination; and/or accordingly may deny you
              access to our Services (or any part thereof).
            </p>

            <h2>ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h2>
            <p>
              The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of
              these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right
              or provision. These Terms of Service and any policies or operating
              rules posted by us on this site or in respect to The Service
              constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between you and

              contemporaneous agreements, communications and proposals, whether
              oral or written, between you and us (including, but not limited
              to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service). Any ambiguities
              in the interpretation of these Terms of Service shall not be
              construed against the drafting party.
